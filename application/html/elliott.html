            <p>San Francisco State University - Senior</p>
            <p>I am a computer science major graduating Spring of 2024. I was introduced to programming through a creative programming class that opened my eyes to the intersection that exists between tech and art.</p>
            <p>I hope to find a career in the game development field or another field that allows for expression and creative flourish through code.</p>
	    <p>For fun I like to camp, hike and play soccer!</p>
